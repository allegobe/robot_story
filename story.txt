On a crisp autumn afternoon, a small, dented robot wandered through narrow streets, its joints squeaking softly with every step. It had no name, only a faint engraving on its chest that time had nearly erased. Drawn by the warm glow of lamplight, it pushed open the heavy doors of an old library. The air inside was still and smelled faintly of paper and cinnamon tea. The robot stood in awe, surrounded by tall shelves that seemed to reach the sky.

The librarian, a gentle man named Theo, found the robot peering curiously at a stack of books. Without a word, he brought over a soft cloth and wiped the rain from its metal frame. Day by day, the robot returned. It learned how to arrange books by color and size, and even how to gently turn pages without tearing them. Theo began reading stories aloud each evening, his voice filling the library like the crackle of a warm fire. The robot stored each tale carefully, not in its circuits, but somewhere it could not quite name.

One snowy night, Theo placed a small knitted scarf around the robot’s neck. “Every library needs a guardian,” he said with a smile. The robot’s sensors whirred quietly, but inside it felt something new—a gentle certainty that it was no longer lost. From then on, it stayed in the old library, greeting visitors with a quiet nod and keeping watch over the stories that had given it a home.

One spring morning, while tidying a forgotten corner, the robot found a dusty wooden box hidden behind a stack of old dictionaries. Inside lay a faded blueprint… of itself. In the corner of the page, in looping handwriting, were the words: For my friend, so you will never be alone. The robot didn’t understand everything on the page, but it understood enough—the library had always been part of its story, even before it arrived.
